# 🌾 AI for Sustainable Development – Crop Yield Prediction

## 📌 SDG Goal: SDG 2 – Zero Hunger

This project uses **Supervised Machine Learning** (Linear Regression) to predict crop yields based on environmental features such as rainfall, temperature, and pesticide usage.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- Google Colab  

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Custom dataset (e.g., Kaggle or FAO)
- Features:
  - `average_rain_fall_mm_per_year`
  - `pesticides_tonnes`
  - `avg_temp`
- Target: `hg/ha_yield`

---

## 🔍 Results
- **MAE**: 64,079  
- **R² Score**: 0.028  
- The model shows initial correlation; accuracy can improve with more refined or larger datasets.

## ⚖️ Ethical Consideration
Model may not generalize to all crops/regions due to data diversity. It’s important to validate with real-world farm data and consider fairness across farmers of different scales.
